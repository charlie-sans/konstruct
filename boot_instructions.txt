# Booting Your Custom OS on Dell Optiplex 9010

## Preparation:
1. Build your OS using 'make clean && make' for BIOS or 'make clean && make uefi' for UEFI

## BIOS Boot (Legacy):
1. Power on your Dell Optiplex 9010
2. Press F2 repeatedly during startup to enter BIOS setup
3. Navigate to "Boot Sequence" or similar
4. Set "Boot List Option" to "Legacy" 
5. Ensure that USB or CD/DVD is in the boot order (before the hard drive)
6. Save changes and exit (usually F10)
7. Create bootable media using create_usb.sh or create_iso.sh script
8. Press F12 at boot to select boot device

## UEFI Boot:
1. Power on your Dell Optiplex 9010
2. Press F2 repeatedly during startup to enter BIOS setup
3. Navigate to "Boot Sequence" or similar
4. Set "Boot List Option" to "UEFI"
5. Disable "Secure Boot" if enabled
6. Save changes and exit (usually F10)

### Creating UEFI USB Boot Drive:
1. Build UEFI version: make clean && make uefi
2. Format a USB drive as FAT32
3. Create the following folder structure on the USB drive:
   USB_DRIVE/
   └── EFI/
       └── BOOT/
           └── BOOTX64.EFI  (copy from uefi_image/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI)
4. Copy kernel.bin to the root of the USB drive
5. Insert the USB drive and press F12 at boot to select UEFI USB

## Troubleshooting:
- For UEFI boot issues:
  * Ensure Secure Boot is disabled
  * Ensure your USB drive is formatted as FAT32
  * Verify the correct folder structure (EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI)
  * Try updating your BIOS to the latest version

- For boot failures:
  * Check the proper build command was used (BIOS vs UEFI)
  * Verify your EFI application was built correctly
  * Try another USB drive or USB port

Remember: UEFI booting requires specific hardware/firmware support. Most Dell Optiplex 9010 
models should support UEFI boot as they are relatively modern systems.
